# EvidenceChain

# Dependencies

Project uses the following tools (I believe that's all)

- truffle (`npm install truffle -g` - evidently requires `npm`, and Node v12+ if I recall correctly)
- geth (`sudo apt install geth`)
- ipfs (`[sudo] snap install ipfs`)
- pipenv (`sudo apt install pipenv`)

# How to run

Look at the `README.md` in `ethereum_network/`.
