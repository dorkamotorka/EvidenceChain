# EvidenceChain

A recently proposed way to achieve better IoT security and zero-trust architecture using blockchain technology includes an immutable ledger, a decentralized peer-to-peer network and a well-established low-level cryptographic algorithm. 
This project aims to utilize and implement those features, for the sake of proof-of-concept. 

# Dependencies

Project uses the following tools (I believe that's all)

- truffle (`npm install truffle -g` - evidently requires `npm`, and Node v12+ if I recall correctly)
- geth (`sudo apt install geth`)
- ipfs (`[sudo] snap install ipfs`)
- pipenv (`sudo apt install pipenv`)

# How to run

Look at the `how_to_launch_network.txt` in `ethereum_network/`.
